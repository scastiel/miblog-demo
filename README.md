This is the source for the demo blog of [Miblog](https://github.com/scastiel/miblog), a minimalistic static blog management system.

You can access the demo blog at [scastiel.github.io/miblog-demo](https://scastiel.github.io/miblog-demo).

Note that the files are generated into *docs* folder, so that I can use [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/) feature to serve the blog at the address mentionned above.
